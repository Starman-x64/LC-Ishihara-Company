# Ishihara Company v1.0.0
### Client-side modification that adjusts view monitor colours for colour-blind employees.

This modification changes the red dots and door codes on the view monitor to magenta/hot pink to assist employees with red-green colour vision deficiency (specifically deuteranopia). This will also affect any additional modifications which provide an alternate method to access the view monitor (e.g. minimaps). We trust you will now be a greater asset to the company.

## Future Additions
- Support for other kinds of colour blindness.
  - I am not colour blind. I made this mod for my friend who is. If you have a colour blindness which isn't supported and would like to help me test the colours, contact me on discord (starman_x64).
- Additional option in settings menu.
